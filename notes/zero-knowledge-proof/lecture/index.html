            <aside class="notes">
            I'm going to discuss about zero knowledge on steroids called secure multi-party computation 
            and what you can do about it. This has been tailored for web3 development.

            ### Data science
            <img src="./pharma.png">
            <aside class="notes">
            Let's start with some kind of flavor.Suppose I'm a brilliant a data scientist and 
            I want to work with brilliant pharmaceutical corporation that is doing tests on ground 
            breaking medication but they don't have a really strong data science team. 
            I am a super strong data scientist but I don't really have the access to the patients medicine data. 
            We can have only if we trusted each other then everything is good.
            if we sign NDA that's really nice, but that has all kinds of problems with compliance.
            What we really want is to keep information private. I want to keep private and the corporation 
            wants to keep the patient data private but we want to gain all the benefit as if we were divulging all our
            information. That's the kind of tasks we're going to talk about today.

            ### Voting
            <img src="./voting.png" width="400">
            <aside class="notes">
            For example Tinder. I am speaking to Alice. We want to know whether we both swipe right, but I don't want Alice to know 
            what I swiped in particular and Alice also wants to keep her swipe private for me. 
            Right now we use the tinder servers. Tinder is the trusted intermediary that does the computation of 
            the end function of whether we are both interested? 
            But we want to really decentralize it and the question is how to get that functionality without trusting a central party? 
            
            Voting is the same thing 
            We want to compute who won the election but all the votes need to be kept private

            ### Sending money
            <img src="./send-money.png">
            <aside class="notes">
            An application you may know very well - sending money.
            Right now if I use Bitcoin my public key is posted online as well as the amount of money I transferred right.
            But if we use a bank to do a transfer the bank doesn't divulge anything when I transfer money to someone I don't want anyone on the internet to know anything 
            about that I passed some money around.
            So testing intermediaries give us privacy right. Now assuming we toss them but the Bitcoin network doesn't quite. 
            There is a solution for this.
            You may well know solution called Z cashing. 
            Z cash people can transfer money to other people without anyone knowing that anything interesting has happened beyond that someone transferred 
            some amount of money to someone else. 
            So Z cash does solve this. 
            But what happens with web applications

            ### Topics
            * Cryptographically provable privacy
            * Private computation
            <aside class="notes">
            so What we're going to talk about today is privacy technology 
            we're going to talk about 
            provable privacy
            cryptographically (privacy that you know it's a queue it's not just heuristic it's cryptographically provable) 
            private computation (not private communication)

            ### Agenda
            * Privacy on blockchain
            * Implementation of private computation
            * Real applications based on privacy
            * Private computation for DApps 
            <aside class="notes">
            So the agenda will be 
            why you should care about privacy on the blockchain in particular about private computation
            you're going to see a little bit about how cryptographers implement private computations and what the primitives look like 
            and how you should think about this.
            we're going to talk about some really great futuristic applications 
            I'm going to take it down and tell you as web3 developers what you should be thinking about if you want you to make your applications private.

            ### Privacy on blockchain
            <img src="privacy-on-bc.png">
            <aside class="notes">
            Blockchain privacy is inherently broken. 
            If you use a wallet to pay for a pizza and then you use a wallet with same public key to pay for a bag of weed 
            then the cops can come and ask the pizza salesman where did they deliver too and come arrest you right. 
            That's the way that Bitcoin works, if you use the same public key twice you may say well I never use the same public key twice.
            
            Using mixer, you have to use it twice once to get the money and 
            wants to give out money to send out money 
            but suppose you only use it twice you're super safe using mixing networks.
            
            The companies that do chain analysis for example to prevent detect and investigate crypto-currency money
            laundering, fraud and compliance violations is clearly the biggest problem in the world.
            So all your Bitcoin transfers are not actually secure if some motivated enough analyzer wants to find out who you are.
            
            They will do so. The real problem is privacy has been promised.
            If you ask people who know about Bitcoin what bitcoin is they'll tell you 
            it's a private way to send money secretly.Solutions are using Zcash, Monello , corda etc

            ### Privacy for web3 application
            <img src="uber.png">
            <aside class="notes">
            But what about your web3 applications? 

            Example Uber
            Well I'm going to argue that private computation and not private communication is really important for web3 applications. 
            Suppose you as a dapp developer really want to decentralize uber then how will you do that?
            uber is a really complicated business logic. 
            You need to preserve reputation
            You need to calculate how much someone pays for the drive and so on 
            so because of that you need to all of the way you'd naturally implement Uber. 
            On the blockchain is to post all of the private information on other chain or in the blocks and and you need to do that clearly because 
            you have to compute stuff from it. For example the reputation change is the business logic and therefore things need to be posted in
            clearly.  That means that if I'm trying to spy on your users, I'm going to manage to spy them very well. 
            I'm going to see Donald Trump took ride at 2 a.m. 
            I'm going to see that because you need to compute reputation changes and money and stuff like that with private communication 
            you can't hide this data and still get the business logic but with private computation you can.
            With private computation in the blockchain the block will look like the one on the right saying everything is garbled except the actually actionable changes
            like reputation change.
            People say that Millennials don't care about privacy and the privacy is dead.
            But that's not actually true. Millennials don't care about privacy as much as the older generation does 
            but they still care they wouldn't post their DNA online or browsing history on the Facebook account

            ### Fostering Collaboration 
            <img src="more-privacy.png">
            <aside class="notes">             
            The interesting thing is that if we really find a way to secure the privacy of users in-depth we're going to get people to share much more information
            both end users and also corporations and businesses. 
            Alike now stock by compliance GDPR and stuff like that from sharing a lot of data and the insight is that the more data you get people to share the more
            positive some value is created right so privacy and privacy tech is really good for all of us because 
            it's fosters collaboration that's why I don't like to think of it as privacy tech but rather collaboration tech in a perfect world 
            where everything is computed privately. 
            We would have lots and lots of positive collaborations and that's good for everyone even for those who don't care about particular issues of privacy

            ### Private Computation 
            * Zero Knowledge Proofs
            * Secure Multiparty Computation
            * zk-Snarks
            * Homomorphic Encryption
            * Secure Function Evaluation
            * Trusted Execution Environments
            <aside class="notes">  
            Ok so before going to talk about how cryptographers implement this technology I want to kind of straighten out the buzzwords that we'll all see
            So the private computation that we'll talk about today is stuff like zero knowledge proof and secure multi-party computation 
            Those are the basic primitives we'll talk about. 
            There's a whole different area of cryptography called private communication that's the stuff with kind of more familiar with
            like public key cryptography and proxy encryption and the way to think.
            These are completely different types of technology were from all science one of them is private communication which was started in the
            70s by people on the right who is Rivest Shamir and Adleman
            The other one private computation was started in the 90s by people like Shafi. 
            It's very important to remember that these are very different types of science and we're also not going to talk about other privacy
            technology like IP spoofing, the financial privacy and so on. 
            We're going to concentrate on the leftmost side.
            Now let me tell you a little bit about how cryptographers achieve privacy on the blockchain or private computation in general. 
            First of all I need to define what I mean when I talk about privacy - private computation. 
            What does this actually entail? 
            So here's a definition of the strongest primitive for private computation and it's kind of the simplest to explain as well it's
            called secure multi-party computation. This originates in the 80s with the work of Viau on "the millionaires problem". 
            So this was introduced let's say 82 and they started about 20 years of research and still ongoing. 
            So the primitive is defined as follows 
            You have n players that want to compute a joint function of the inputs so each of the player of the  have a private input X  that really want to keep private.
